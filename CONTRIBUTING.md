## Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

- `feat:` A new feature
- `fix:` A bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation only changes
- `style:` Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor:` A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf:` A code change that improves performance
- `test:` Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore:` Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

## Testing Guidelines

- Write tests for any new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Test edge cases

Example test:
```typescript
import { test, expect } from "bun:test"
import { getCitations } from "../src"

test("should extract full case citation", () => {
  const text = "Bush v. Gore, 531 U.S. 98 (2000)"
  const citations = getCitations(text)
  
  expect(citations).toHaveLength(1)
  expect(citations[0].constructor.name).toBe("FullCaseCitation")
})
```

## Style Guide

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing code style
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Keep functions small and focused
