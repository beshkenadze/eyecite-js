# eyecite-js Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the development plan for eyecite-js based on the comprehensive gap analysis between the Python and JavaScript implementations.

## üéØ Vision

To create the most performant and comprehensive legal citation extraction library in the JavaScript ecosystem, maintaining feature parity with Python eyecite while leveraging JavaScript's strengths.

## üìç Current Status (v2.7.6-alpha.19)

- ‚úÖ **Core citation extraction** - All major citation types supported
- ‚úÖ **Id. citation resolution** - Advanced resolution with section substitution
- ‚úÖ **Multiple section parsing** - Complex C.F.R. patterns fully supported
- ‚úÖ **TypeScript support** - Full type safety
- ‚úÖ **335 passing tests** - Comprehensive test coverage
- ‚úÖ **Production ready** - For normal document processing workloads

## üìä Success Metrics

### Performance Targets
- Process 1,000 pages/second on standard hardware
- < 100ms latency for single document processing
- < 1GB memory usage for 10,000 pages
- WebAssembly speedup of 5-10x

### Quality Targets
- 99.9% accuracy on standard citations
- 95% accuracy on edge cases
- Zero false positives for DOL/CFR citations
- 100% backward compatibility

### Community Targets
- Active community engagement
- Regular contributions
- Production deployments
- Comprehensive documentation

## ü§ù Contributing

We welcome contributions! Priority areas:

1. **Testing**: Port Python tests, add edge cases
2. **Performance**: Optimization ideas and benchmarks
3. **Documentation**: Examples and tutorials
4. **Integrations**: Framework bindings and tools

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.

## üìÖ Release Philosophy

This is an open-source project maintained by volunteers. Features will be released when they're ready, tested, and documented. We prioritize:

1. **Quality over speed** - Thoroughly tested code
2. **Community needs** - Features requested by users
3. **Maintainability** - Clean, documented code
4. **Backward compatibility** - No breaking changes in minor versions

## üè∑Ô∏è Version Strategy

We maintain version **2.7.6** to match the Python eyecite version we're porting. Until we achieve full feature parity with Python eyecite v2.7.6, we'll use:

- **v2.7.6-alpha.X** - Development releases with new features
- **v2.7.6-beta.X** - Feature complete, testing phase
- **v2.7.6-rc.X** - Release candidates
- **v2.7.6** - Full parity with Python eyecite v2.7.6

### Post-Parity Versioning

Once we achieve feature parity:
- **v2.8.x** - JavaScript-specific enhancements
- **v3.0.0** - Major improvements (WebAssembly, breaking changes)
- **v4.0.0** - Next generation features (ML, multi-language)

## üìù Notes

- This roadmap is aspirational and subject to change
- Community feedback shapes priorities
- Contributions welcome for any roadmap item
- No deadlines - features ship when ready
